# app.py
* Sure, let's break down the lines of code you provided:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, render_template, redirect, url_for, flash
```
Here, you're importing various modules and functions from Flask. 
- `Flask` is the main class of the Flask framework, used to create Flask web applications.
- `request` is used to access incoming request data such as form data or request headers.
- `render_template` is used to render HTML templates.
- `redirect` is used to redirect the user to a different endpoint or URL.
- `url_for` is used to generate URLs for Flask routes.
- `flash` is used to display flash messages, which are temporary messages typically used for feedback to the user.

```python
from flask_login import LoginManager, UserMixin, login_user, login_required, logout_user, current_user
```
Here, you're importing modules and functions from Flask-Login, which is a Flask extension that provides user session management and authentication.
- `LoginManager` is used to manage user sessions and authentication.
- `UserMixin` is a mixin class provided by Flask-Login that provides default implementations for the methods required by the user model.
- `login_user` is used to log in a user.
- `login_required` is a decorator that can be used to protect routes that require authentication.
- `logout_user` is used to log out a user.
- `current_user` is a proxy to the current user object. 

```python
from flask_mysqldb import MySQL
```
This line imports the MySQL class from the Flask-MySQLdb extension, which provides MySQL integration for Flask applications. It allows Flask applications to interact with MySQL databases.

```python
from flask_bcrypt import Bcrypt
```
Here, you're importing the Bcrypt class from the Flask-Bcrypt extension. Bcrypt is a password hashing library used for securely hashing passwords before storing them in a database.

```python
import uuid  # For generating unique tokens
import smtplib  # For sending emails
from email.mime.text import MIMEText  # For composing email content
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart  # For composing email content
```
These lines import modules and classes related to email functionality and generating unique tokens. 
- `uuid` is a module used for generating universally unique identifiers (UUIDs).
- `smtplib` is a module used for sending emails using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).
- `MIMEText` is a class for creating email message objects with plain text content.
- `MIMEMultipart` is a class for creating email message objects with multiple parts, such as both plain text and HTML content.

The code you've provided seems to be setting up a Flask application with user authentication, MySQL database integration, password hashing, and email functionality. If you have any specific questions about how any of these components work or how they're being used in your application, feel free to ask!

Certainly! Let's go through each line of the code:

```python
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=DeprecationWarning)
```
This line suppresses the display of warnings related to `DeprecationWarning` category. Warnings are issued by Python or third-party libraries to alert you of potential issues or deprecated features. In this case, it's ignoring warnings of the `DeprecationWarning` category, which typically indicates that a feature is deprecated and may be removed in future versions of Python or its related libraries.

```python
model = pickle.load(open('models/RandomForest.pkl','rb'))
```
This line loads a machine learning model from a file named 'RandomForest.pkl' using Python's `pickle` module. `pickle` is used for serializing and deserializing Python objects, effectively converting them into byte streams for storage or transmission. In this case, it's loading a pre-trained Random Forest model from a file.

```python
app = Flask(__name__)
```
Here, you're creating an instance of the Flask class and assigning it to the variable `app`. The `__name__` variable is a special Python variable that holds the name of the current Python module. Passing it to the `Flask` constructor helps Flask locate resources such as templates and static files.

```python
app.secret_key = "********************"
```
This line sets the secret key for the Flask application. The secret key is used to cryptographically sign cookies and other data that is sent to the client. It's important for security purposes, such as protecting against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.

```python
app.config['MYSQL_HOST'] = 'localhost'
app.config['MYSQL_USER'] = 'root'
app.config['MYSQL_PASSWORD'] = '12345'
app.config['MYSQL_DB'] = 'flask'
```
These lines configure the MySQL database connection settings for the Flask application. It sets the host (`MYSQL_HOST`), username (`MYSQL_USER`), password (`MYSQL_PASSWORD`), and database name (`MYSQL_DB`) to be used by the Flask-MySQLdb extension. This configuration allows the Flask application to connect to the specified MySQL database.

Each line plays a crucial role in setting up the Flask application, loading a machine learning model, and configuring the MySQL database connection. If you have any further questions or need clarification on any part, feel free to ask!

Let's break down each line:

```python
mysql = MySQL(app)
```
Here, you're creating an instance of the `MySQL` class from the Flask-MySQLdb extension and passing the Flask application instance `app` to it. This binds the MySQL database configuration previously set in the Flask application to the MySQL instance `mysql`, allowing the Flask application to interact with the MySQL database.

```python
bcrypt = Bcrypt(app)
```
This line creates an instance of the `Bcrypt` class from the Flask-Bcrypt extension and passes the Flask application instance `app` to it. This binds the Flask application to the Bcrypt instance `bcrypt`, allowing you to use Bcrypt for password hashing and verification within your Flask application.

```python
login_manager = LoginManager()
login_manager.init_app(app)
```
These lines initialize the `LoginManager` instance `login_manager` and associate it with the Flask application instance `app`. The `LoginManager` manages the user authentication system in Flask applications. By initializing it with the Flask application, Flask-Login extension knows which application to work with.

```python
@login_manager.user_loader
def load_user(email):
    return User.get(email)
```
This is a decorator used to register a user loader function with the `login_manager`. The `user_loader` callback is used to reload the user object from the user ID stored in the session. In this case, it's defining a function `load_user` that takes an email as an argument and returns the corresponding `User` object. This function is used by Flask-Login to retrieve the user object based on the user's email.

```python
class User(UserMixin):
    def __init__(self, user_id,name, email):
        self.id = user_id
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
```
This defines a `User` class that inherits from `UserMixin`, which is provided by Flask-Login. The `UserMixin` class provides default implementations for the methods required by the user model. Inside the `User` class, you're defining an `__init__` method to initialize the user object with `user_id`, `name`, and `email` attributes. This class represents the user model in your application.

These lines collectively set up the user authentication system, including database interaction, password hashing, and user loading, within your Flask application. If you have any further questions or need clarification on any part, feel free to ask!

Let's break down the method:

```python
@staticmethod
    def get(user_id):
```
This decorator is used to declare a method as a static method within the `User` class. Static methods in Python are methods that are bound to the class rather than the instance of the class. They can be called on the class itself without needing an instance.

```python
cursor = mysql.connection.cursor()
```
Here, you're obtaining a cursor object from the MySQL connection using the `cursor()` method. The cursor object allows you to execute SQL queries and fetch data from the database.

```python
cursor.execute('select name, email from users where id = %s',(user_id,))
```
This line executes an SQL query to select the `name` and `email` columns from the `users` table where the `id` matches the provided `user_id`. The `%s` placeholder is used for parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. The `user_id` value is passed as a parameter to the query.

```python
result = cursor.fetchone()
```
After executing the query, this line fetches the first row of the result set returned by the query and assigns it to the `result` variable. Since we expect only one row to be returned (based on the `id` condition), we use `fetchone()` method.

```python
cursor.close()
```
This line closes the cursor object to release the database resources. It's good practice to close the cursor when you're done with it to avoid potential memory leaks or resource exhaustion.

```python
if result:
            return User(user_id, result[0],result[1])
```
This conditional block checks if `result` contains any data. If it does, it constructs and returns a new `User` object using the `user_id`, `name`, and `email` retrieved from the database. The `User` object is then returned by the `get()` method.

This method essentially retrieves a user from the database based on the provided `user_id` and returns a corresponding `User` object.

These code snippets define various routes in your Flask application. Let's break down each one:

```python
@app.route('/')
def index1():
    return render_template('index1.html')
```
This route decorator binds the URL `'/'` to the `index1()` function. When a user navigates to the root URL of your website (e.g., `http://yourdomain.com/`), Flask will call the `index1()` function, which renders the `index1.html` template using the `render_template` function.

```python
@app.route('/about.html')
def about():
    return render_template('about.html')
```
This route decorator binds the URL `'/about.html'` to the `about()` function. When a user navigates to `http://yourdomain.com/about.html`, Flask will call the `about()` function, which renders the `about.html` template.

```python
@app.route('/features.html')
def features():
    return render_template('features.html')
```
This route decorator binds the URL `'/features.html'` to the `features()` function. When a user navigates to `http://yourdomain.com/features.html`, Flask will call the `features()` function, which renders the `features.html` template.

```python
@app.route('/contact.html')
def contact():
    return render_template('contact.html')
```
This route decorator binds the URL `'/contact.html'` to the `contact()` function. When a user navigates to `http://yourdomain.com/contact.html`, Flask will call the `contact()` function, which renders the `contact.html` template.

```python
@app.route('/det.html')
def det():
    return render_template('det.html')
```
This route decorator binds the URL `'/det.html'` to the `det()` function. When a user navigates to `http://yourdomain.com/det.html`, Flask will call the `det()` function, which renders the `det.html` template.

Overall, these route functions handle requests to different URLs of your web application and render the respective HTML templates. This setup allows you to create a multi-page website with different content on each page.

This route handles both GET and POST requests to the '/login' URL:

```python
@app.route('/login', methods = ['GET','POST'])
```
The route decorator binds the URL '/login' to the 'login()' function and specifies that this route should respond to both GET and POST requests.

```python
if request.method == 'POST':
```
This condition checks if the incoming request method is POST. If it is, it means that the user has submitted the login form.

```python
email = request.form['email']
password = request.form['password']
```
These lines extract the email and password entered by the user from the form submitted with the POST request.

```python
cursor = mysql.connection.cursor()
cursor.execute('select id,name,email, password from users where email = %s', (email,))
user_data = cursor.fetchone()
cursor.close()
```
Here, you're querying the database to retrieve user data based on the provided email. It executes an SQL SELECT statement to fetch the user's id, name, email, and hashed password from the 'users' table where the email matches the provided email. Then, it fetches the first row of the result set using 'fetchone()' and stores it in 'user_data'.

```python
if user_data and bcrypt.check_password_hash(user_data[3], password):
```
This condition checks if 'user_data' contains any data (i.e., if a user with the provided email exists in the database) and if the provided password matches the hashed password stored in the database. It uses 'bcrypt.check_password_hash()' to compare the provided password with the hashed password retrieved from the database.

```python
user = User(user_data[0],user_data[1],user_data[2])
login_user(user)
```
If the email and password are valid, a new User object is created using the user's id, name, and email retrieved from the database. Then, this user is logged in using 'login_user(user)', which is a function provided by Flask-Login for logging in users.

```python
flash('login successfully insert the data and predict the crop', 'success')
```
A flash message is added to provide feedback to the user that they have successfully logged in. The 'success' category is used for styling purposes.

```python
return render_template('new.html')
```
If the login is successful, the user is redirected to the 'new.html' template, which presumably is a new page or a dashboard page.

```python
else:
    flash('Invalid email or password. Please try again.', 'error')
```
If the provided email or password is invalid, a flash message is added to inform the user that their login attempt was unsuccessful.

```python
return render_template('login.html')
```
If the request method is GET or if the login attempt was unsuccessful (i.e., the request method is POST but the provided email or password is invalid), the user is redirected back to the 'login.html' template to display the login form again.

Overall, this route handles user authentication by verifying the provided email and password against the database and logging in the user if the credentials are valid. Flash messages are used to provide feedback to the user about the login attempt.

This route handles both GET and POST requests to the '/signup' URL:

```python
@app.route('/signup', methods = ['GET','POST'])
```
The route decorator binds the URL '/signup' to the 'signup()' function and specifies that this route should respond to both GET and POST requests.

```python
if request.method == 'POST':
```
This condition checks if the incoming request method is POST. If it is, it means that the user has submitted the signup form.

```python
name = request.form['name']
email = request.form['email']
password = request.form['password']
```
These lines extract the name, email, and password entered by the user from the form submitted with the POST request.

```python
cursor = mysql.connection.cursor()
cursor.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE email = %s', (email,))
count = cursor.fetchone()[0]
cursor.close()
```
Here, you're querying the database to check if the provided email already exists in the 'users' table. It executes an SQL SELECT statement to count the number of rows where the email matches the provided email. Then, it fetches the count using 'fetchone()' and stores it in 'count'.

```python
if count > 0:
    flash('Email already taken. Please choose a different email.', 'error')
    return redirect(url_for('signup'))
```
If the provided email already exists in the database (i.e., count > 0), a flash message is added to inform the user that the email is already taken. The user is redirected back to the signup page using 'redirect(url_for('signup'))'.

```python
hashed_password = bcrypt.generate_password_hash(password).decode('utf-8')
```
Here, you're generating a hashed version of the provided password using Bcrypt's 'generate_password_hash()' function. The hashed password is decoded to UTF-8 format before storing it in the database.

```python
cursor = mysql.connection.cursor()
cursor.execute('insert into users (name,email,password) values(%s,%s,%s)',(name,email,hashed_password))
mysql.connection.commit()
cursor.close()
```
After validating the email, a new record is inserted into the 'users' table in the database with the provided name, email, and hashed password.

```python
flash('Account created successfully. You can now login.', 'success')
return redirect(url_for('login'))
```
A flash message is added to inform the user that their account has been successfully created. The user is then redirected to the login page using 'redirect(url_for('login'))'.

```python
return render_template('signup.html')
```
If the request method is GET or if there was an issue with the signup form submission, the user is redirected back to the 'signup.html' template to display the signup form again.

Overall, this route handles user registration by validating the provided email, hashing the password, inserting the user data into the database, and providing feedback to the user through flash messages. If you have any further questions or need clarification on any part, feel free to ask!

Let's go through each line of the code:

```python
@app.route("/predict",methods=['POST'])
@login_required
```
This route decorator binds the URL '/predict' to the 'predict()' function and specifies that this route should respond only to POST requests. Additionally, the `@login_required` decorator ensures that only authenticated users can access this route.

```python
def predict():
```
This is the definition of the `predict()` function, which handles the prediction of the crop based on the provided input data.

```python
N = request.form['Nitrogen']
P = request.form['Phosporus']
k = request.form['Potassium']
temperature = request.form['Temperature']
humidity = request.form['Humidity']
ph = request.form['Ph']
rainfall = request.form['Rainfall']
```
These lines extract the input data (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, pH, Rainfall) submitted via the POST request form.

```python
feature_list = [N,P,k,temperature,humidity,ph,rainfall]
features = np.array([[feature_list]]).reshape(1, -1)
```
Here, you're constructing a feature list containing the input data, which is then converted into a NumPy array and reshaped into the required format (1 sample, multiple features) for making predictions.

```python
prediction = model.predict(features)[0]
```
This line uses the trained machine learning model (`model`) to make a prediction based on the input features. The `predict()` method is called on the model, passing the input features, and the predicted crop is obtained.

```python
print(prediction)
```
This line prints the predicted crop to the console for debugging purposes.

```python
crop_list = ["rice", "maize", "jute", "cotton", "coconut", "papaya", "orange",
         "apple", "muskmelon", "watermelon", "grapes", "mango", "banana",
         "pomegranate", "lentil", "blackgram", "mungbean", "mothbeans",
         "pigeonpeas", "kidneybeans", "chickpea", "coffee"]
```
Here, you're defining a list of crops that are considered suitable for cultivation.

```python
if prediction in crop_list:
```
This condition checks if the predicted crop is present in the `crop_list`.

```python
result = "{} is a best crop to be cultivated. ".format(prediction)
```
If the predicted crop is found in the `crop_list`, this message is generated indicating that the predicted crop is suitable for cultivation.

```python
else:
    result = "Sorry, we could not determine the best crop to be cultivated with the provided data."
```
If the predicted crop is not found in the `crop_list`, this message is generated indicating that the best crop could not be determined with the provided data.

```python
flash('Check the result.', 'succes')
```
A flash message is added to inform the user to check the result. The 'success' category is used for styling purposes.

```python
return render_template('new.html',result = result)
```
The result is passed to the 'new.html' template using the `render_template()` function. The 'new.html' template will display the result to the user.

Overall, this route function handles the prediction of the best crop based on the input data provided by the user and displays the result to the user. Flash messages are used to provide feedback to the user about the prediction process.

Let's break down each line:

```python
@app.route('/logout')
```
This route decorator binds the URL '/logout' to the 'logout()' function.

```python
@login_required
```
The `@login_required` decorator ensures that only authenticated users can access this route. If a user tries to access '/logout' without being logged in, they will be redirected to the login page.

```python
def logout():
```
This is the definition of the `logout()` function, which handles the user logout process.

```python
logout_user()
```
This function is provided by Flask-Login and is used to log out the current user.

```python
flash('logout successful see you soon.', 'success')
```
A flash message is added to inform the user that their logout was successful. The 'success' category is used for styling purposes.

```python
return redirect(url_for('index1'))
```
After logging out the user, the function redirects them to the 'index1' route using `redirect(url_for('index1'))`. This typically redirects the user to the homepage or the landing page of the website.

Overall, this route function handles the user logout process, logging out the user and providing feedback through a flash message, and then redirecting them to the homepage.

Let's dissect each part of the code:

```python
@app.route('/forgot_password', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
```
This route decorator binds the URL '/forgot_password' to the 'forgot_password()' function and specifies that this route should respond to both GET and POST requests.

```python
def forgot_password():
```
This function handles the logic for resetting a forgotten password.

```python
if request.method == 'POST':
```
This condition checks if the incoming request method is POST. If it is, it means that the user has submitted the forgot password form.

```python
email = request.form['email']
```
This line retrieves the email address entered by the user from the form submitted with the POST request.

```python
cursor = mysql.connection.cursor()
cursor.execute('SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = %s', (email,))
user_id = cursor.fetchone()
cursor.close()
```
Here, you're querying the database to check if the provided email exists in the 'users' table. It executes an SQL SELECT statement to fetch the user's id based on the provided email. Then, it fetches the id using 'fetchone()' and stores it in 'user_id'.

```python
if user_id:
```
This condition checks if 'user_id' contains any data (i.e., if a user with the provided email exists in the database).

```python
token = str(uuid.uuid4())
```
A unique token is generated for password reset using `uuid.uuid4()`.

```python
cursor = mysql.connection.cursor()
cursor.execute('UPDATE users SET reset_token = %s WHERE id = %s', (token, user_id[0]))
mysql.connection.commit()
cursor.close()
```
The generated token is saved in the database for the user with the corresponding id, allowing them to reset their password later.

```python
send_reset_email(email, token)
```
An email containing the password reset instructions, including the unique token, is sent to the user's email address.

```python
flash('Password reset instructions have been sent to your email.', 'success')
```
A flash message is added to inform the user that password reset instructions have been sent to their email address.

```python
else:
    flash('Email address not found. Please try again.', 'error')
```
If the provided email address is not found in the database, a flash message is added to inform the user to try again.

```python
return render_template('forgot_password.html')
```
If the request method is GET or if there was an issue with the forgot password form submission, the user is redirected back to the 'forgot_password.html' template to display the forgot password form again.

Overall, this route function handles the process of resetting a forgotten password. It checks if the provided email exists in the database, generates and saves a unique token for password reset, sends an email with the password reset instructions, and provides feedback to the user through flash messages.

This function `send_reset_email(email, token)` is responsible for sending an email containing the password reset instructions to the provided email address with a unique token for password reset. Let's break down the logic:

```python
smtp_server = 'smtp.gmail.com'
smtp_port = 587
```
These lines define the SMTP server address and port. In this case, it's using Gmail's SMTP server on port 587.

```python
sender_email = 'abcd@gmail.com'
sender_password = '**** **** **** ****'
```
These lines specify the sender's email address and password. Replace 'abcd@gmail.com' with your actual Gmail address and '**** **** **** ****' with your Gmail password or an app password if you have two-factor authentication enabled.

```python
receiver_email = email
```
This line sets the receiver's email address to the provided email parameter.

```python
message = MIMEMultipart()
message['From'] = sender_email
message['To'] = receiver_email
message['Subject'] = 'Password Reset Request'
```
Here, you're creating an instance of `MIMEMultipart()` to compose the email message. You set the sender, receiver, and subject of the email.

```python
body = f"""
To reset your password, click the following link:
http://localhost:5000/reset_password?token={token}
"""
```
This is the body of the email message, which contains the password reset instructions along with the unique token. The token is appended to the reset password URL as a query parameter.

```python
message.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))
```
The body of the email message is attached to the `message` object as plain text.

```python
with smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, smtp_port) as server:
    server.starttls()
    server.login(sender_email, sender_password)
    server.send_message(message)
```
This block establishes a connection to the SMTP server, enables TLS encryption, logs in to the server using the sender's email address and password, and sends the email message.

This function uses the SMTP protocol to send the email. Make sure to replace the sender's email address and password with your actual credentials, and adjust the SMTP server and port if you're using a different email service provider.

Let's go through the provided code:

```python
@app.route('/reset_password', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
```
This route decorator binds the URL '/reset_password' to the 'reset_password()' function and specifies that this route should respond to both GET and POST requests.

```python
def reset_password():
```
This function handles the logic for resetting the user's password.

```python
if request.method == 'POST':
```
This condition checks if the incoming request method is POST. If it is, it means that the user has submitted the reset password form.

```python
token = request.form['token']
new_password = request.form['password']
confirm_password = request.form['confirm_password']
```
These lines extract the token and new password entered by the user from the form submitted with the POST request.

```python
if new_password != confirm_password:
    flash('Passwords do not match. Please try again.', 'error')
    return render_template('login.html')
```
This condition checks if the new password and confirm password entered by the user match. If they don't match, a flash message is added to inform the user, and they are redirected back to the login page to try again.

```python
cursor.execute('SELECT id FROM users WHERE reset_token = %s', (token,))
user = cursor.fetchone()
```
Here, you're querying the database to check if the provided token exists in the 'reset_token' column of the 'users' table. It executes an SQL SELECT statement to fetch the user's id based on the provided token. Then, it fetches the id using 'fetchone()' and stores it in 'user'.

```python
if user:
```
This condition checks if 'user' contains any data (i.e., if a user with the provided token exists in the database).

```python
hashed_password = bcrypt.generate_password_hash(new_password).decode('utf-8')
```
Here, you're generating a hashed version of the new password using Bcrypt's 'generate_password_hash()' function. The hashed password is decoded to UTF-8 format before storing it in the database.

```python
cursor.execute('UPDATE users SET password = %s, reset_token = NULL WHERE id = %s', (hashed_password, user[0]))
mysql.connection.commit()
```
This block updates the user's password in the database with the new hashed password and clears the reset token associated with the user.

```python
flash("Password reset successful. You can now login with your new password.", "success")
return redirect(url_for('login'))
```
If the password reset is successful, a flash message is added to inform the user, and they are redirected to the login page to log in with their new password.

```python
else:
    flash("Invalid or expired token. Please request a new password reset.", "error")
    return redirect(url_for('forgot_password'))
```
If the provided token is invalid or expired (i.e., no user is found with the token), a flash message is added to inform the user, and they are redirected to the forgot password page to request a new password reset.

```python
token = request.args.get('token')
```
This line retrieves the token value from the URL query parameters.

```python
return render_template('reset_password.html', token=token)
```
If the request method is GET or if there was an issue with the reset password form submission, the user is redirected back to the 'reset_password.html' template to display the reset password form again, with the token value passed to the template.

Sure, let's break down these final parts:

```python
@app.after_request
def add_header(response):
    response.headers["Cache-Control"] = "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"
    response.headers["Pragma"] = "no-cache"
    response.headers["Expires"] = "0"
    return response
```
This function, decorated with `@app.after_request`, adds headers to the response to prevent caching. This is useful for ensuring that sensitive information, such as user authentication status, is not cached by the browser.

```python
@login_manager.unauthorized_handler
def unauthorized():
    flash('You must be logged in to access this page.', 'error')
    return redirect(url_for('login'))
```
This function specifies what happens when a user tries to access a protected route without being logged in. In this case, it adds a flash message to inform the user that they must be logged in to access the page and redirects them to the login page.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```
This conditional statement ensures that the Flask application is only run if the script is executed directly, not if it's imported as a module into another script. When the script is executed directly, the Flask application starts running in debug mode (`debug=True`), which provides helpful debugging information in case of errors.
